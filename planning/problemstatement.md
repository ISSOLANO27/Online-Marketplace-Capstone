# Problem Statement

## Background

Local artisans in areas like Cancun rely on informal and inconsistent channels such as Facebook posts, WhatsApp messages, word-of-mouth referrals, and physical visits to display or sell handcrafted items. My father-in-law inspired this project because he has hundreds of handcrafted pieces stored in his home with no efficient way to showcase or track them. These informal methods create unpredictable exposure, limited sales reach, and poor visibility of his inventory.

As emphasized in Chapter 4 (Requirements Modeling), understanding the current system is the first step in identifying business needs and process inefficiencies. In the present context, the existing process has no central repository for inventory, no structured browsing experience for customers, and no standardized workflow for inquiries or purchase requests.

## Core Problem

There is no centralized digital platform where craftsmen like my father-in-law can publish items, show availability, or manage customer interest. When customers ask for photos, dimensions, or prices, he must send them individually each time. This causes delays, confusion, and missed opportunities. In the language of Chapter 4, this is a classic example of a “business process broken by manual workflows,” which leads directly to unclear requirements and operational inefficiencies.

## Impact on the Problem

* **Craftsman**: Repeats the same information, forgets what items he still has available, and loses track of who requested what.
* **Customers**: Customers have no reliable place to browse items, compare prices or confirm availability.
* **Future business Growth**: Without a structured system, scaling to multiple customers or multiple artisans is nearly impossible. Chapter three emphasized that systems must support decision making in organizational goals, which is not currently possible.

## Scope of the Problem

The major issue revolves around product visiblity, customer communications, and inventory tracking. The absence of a structured system forces both the artisan and the customer to rely on fragmented communication methods that lacks the accuracy and consistency to carry out an efficient process.

## Consequesnces of Inaction

If nothing changes, Craftsman continue losing potential sales. Customers remain confused about availability, and the business cannot scale or support more articiants. This mirrors Chapter One's warning, *systems that do not modernize, limit competitiveness, and harm user experience*.

## Summary

This project will exist to solve a real personal and operational problem. It will give Craftsman a stable, simple platform to display their work and letting customers browse and request items reliably. This aligns with the guidelines in Chapter 4, which emphasizes *identifying the root problem before defining detailed requirements.*
