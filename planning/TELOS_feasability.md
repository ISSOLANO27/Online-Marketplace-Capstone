# Feasibility Analysis(TELOS)
The Artisan Vault

## Technical Feasibility

The Artisan Vault can be developed using widely available, low-cost technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, a lightweight backend framework, and a relational database. Hosting platforms such as GitHub Pages, Vercel, or Render can support deployment without major cost. No advanced or specialized hardware is required.  


## Economic Feasibility

_Can we afford to build AND run this system, especially during its first release?_

The project requires minimal financial investment. Development tools are free, and hosting options offer free tiers sufficient for the Phase 1. The economic risk is low, and the potential long-term value increased sales for artisans and potential revenue from commissions supports the justification. We will run on free hosting until traffic increases.


## Legal Feasibility

The system must comply with basic data privacy practices, particularly regarding customer contact information. _No sensitive financial data is collected_ in Phase 1 since payment processing is out of scope. Artifacts remain compliant with general academic policies and local regulations governing online communication.  


## Operations Feasibility

Artisans can easily learn to upload items, manage availability, and respond to requests. Customers can browse without needing accounts. Admin oversight is minimal and manageable. These conditions align with Chapter 2’s principle that _a system is operationally feasible when users are willing and able to adopt it_.  


## Schedule Feasibility

The system can be designed, developed, and tested within the timeline of the academic semester. The scope is intentionally limited to ensure delivery of a working MVP (Minimal Viable Product). Postponing advanced features like payments or mobile apps ensures the schedule remains realistic.  


## Summary

Based on the TELOS analysis, The Artisan Vault is feasible to build within technical, economic, legal, operational, and schedule constraints. The project should and could move forward to the Analysis Phase.
