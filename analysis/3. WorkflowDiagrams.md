**Project:** The Artisan Vault  
**Artifact:** Business Process / Workflow Diagrams (As-Is)  
**Phase:** Analysis  

---

## 1. Purpose

These workflows describe the **current workflow** business processes used by Mr. Carrión to manage The Artisan Vault. They focus on the **sequence of activities** performed by the artisan and the customer, and will later be used to derive **use cases** and **functional requirements**.

## 2. Workflow #1 – Stock Item `non-custom` Purchase  (As-Is)

### 2.1 Description

This workflow shows how a **non-custom**, stock craft item is sold today, from the moment a customer expresses interest to the point where the item is picked up, paid for, and recorded as sold in Excel.

Actors:
- **Customer**
- **Artisan (Mr. Carrión)**

Systems / tools involved:
- WhatsApp / SMS / Email
- Physical inventory (home storage)
- Notebook
- Excel (sales + inventory file)
- Word (invoice template)

---

### 2.2 Main Flow (Successful Stock Item Sale)

**Step 1 – Customer expresses interest**  
- **Actor:** Customer  
- **Action:** Customer contacts the artisan (usually via WhatsApp/SMS, sometimes word of mouth) asking about available items.  

**Step 2 – Artisan reviews request**  
- **Actor:** Artisan  
- **Action:** Reads the message and interprets what type of craft the customer is looking for (mirror, frame, chair, table, décor, etc.).  

**Step 3 – Artisan checks inventory physically**  
- **Actor:** Artisan  
- **Action:** Physically checks his home inventory to see which items match the customer’s interest.  
- **Note:** This is based on memory plus what he has set aside or stored in bedrooms/living areas.

**Step 4 – Artisan responds with availability and price**  
- **Actor:** Artisan  
- **Action:** Sends the customer a response listing:  
  - which items are available,  
  - the price of each,  
  - and an image if the customer requests one.  

**Step 5 – Customer chooses item and confirms**  
- **Actor:** Customer  
- **Action:** Customer confirms which stock item they want and agrees to the stated price.  

**Step 6 – Artisan records order details in notebook**  
- **Actor:** Artisan  
- **Action:** Only after confirmation, he writes the order in his notebook, including:  
  - customer name  
  - item name/type  
  - quantity  
  - price  
  - date  
  - pickup details  
  - payment status (pending)

**Step 7 – Artisan physically reserves the item**  
- **Actor:** Artisan  
- **Action:** Removes the item from general display/storage and sets it aside (bedroom or living room).  
- **Note:** If the item is fragile (e.g., glass), he wraps it in bubble wrap or cloth.

**Step 8 – Pickup date is agreed**  
- **Actors:** Customer, Artisan  
- **Action:** Through WhatsApp/SMS, they agree on a pickup date.  
- **Constraint:** Artisan aligns pickup time with his 9–5 work schedule but remains flexible.

**Step 9 – Artisan continues normal work until pickup approaches**  
- **Actor:** Artisan  
- **Action:** Continues working on other crafts and possibly other orders; the reserved stock item is mentally prioritized but does not block other work.

**Step 10 – First notification with photo (2 days before pickup)**  
- **Actor:** Artisan  
- **Action:** Two days before the agreed pickup date, the artisan:  
  - takes a photo of the finished/ready piece with his phone,  
  - sends the photo and a short message via WhatsApp/SMS/Email to the customer.  

**Step 11 – Day-of pickup reminder (no photo)**  
- **Actor:** Artisan  
- **Action:** On the day of pickup, sends a simple reminder message (no additional photo) to confirm that the customer is still coming.

**Step 12 – Customer arrives for pickup**  
- **Actors:** Customer, Artisan  
- **Action:** Customer comes to the artisan’s home to inspect and pick up the piece.  

**Step 13 – Payment before handing over item**  
- **Actor:** Customer, Artisan  
- **Action:**  
  - Customer pays **in full**, either cash or bank transfer.  
  - Artisan **never** hands over the item until payment is confirmed.  

**Step 14 – Artisan prepares and finalizes invoice**  
- **Actor:** Artisan  
- **Action:** Using his Word template (often prepared right before the visit), he fills in the invoice details and gives the customer a typed invoice/receipt.

**Step 15 – Item is handed over to customer**  
- **Actor:** Artisan  
- **Action:** Only after payment is confirmed and the invoice is ready, the artisan gives the physical craft item to the customer.

**Step 16 – Excel sales and inventory update**  
- **Actor:** Artisan  
- **Action:** Later (often at night), the artisan:  
  - logs the sale in his Excel sales file,  
  - updates the inventory quantity for that item,  
  - effectively marking the item as **sold**.  

---

### 2.3 Alternate / Exception Path – Customer Cancels Before Pickup (High-Level)

**A1 – Customer cancels reservation**  
- Customer sends a message cancelling the order before pickup.  

**A2 – Artisan eventually frees up inventory**  
- Artisan physically returns the reserved item to general inventory storage.  
- At some later time (not always immediately), he updates Excel to show the item as available again.  
- No follow-up is performed; the artisan does not chase cancelled customers.

*(This alternate path will be expanded later into its own workflow if needed.)*

## 3. Workflow #2 – Custom Order Process (As-Is)

### 3.1 Description

This workflow models the complete **custom craft order** process used today by Señor Carrión. A custom order involves evaluating feasibility, calculating material and labor costs, collecting a mandatory deposit, managing updates and complications, communicating with the customer, and final delivery with full payment. This process is significantly more complex than a stock sale and includes multiple decision points that affect cost, timeline, and workflow continuity.

Actors:
- **Customer**
- **Artisan (Señor Carrión)**

Tools/Systems involved:
- WhatsApp / SMS / Email  
- Notebook  
- Excel (tracking details and materials)  
- Word (invoice template)  
- Physical workspace and storage areas  

---

### 3.2 Main Flow – Successful Custom Order

**Step 1 – Customer requests a custom craft**  
- Customer contacts the artisan through WhatsApp/SMS asking if a specific custom piece is possible.  
- Customer may send an idea, reference photo, or general description.

**Step 2 – Artisan evaluates feasibility**  
- Artisan takes time to analyze the request.  
- He determines whether the project is realistic based on:  
  - required materials  
  - skill complexity  
  - size  
  - labor hours  
  - his current workload  
- If the project is not feasible, he declines politely.

**Step 3 – Artisan performs material cost estimation**  
- Gathers receipts or past references for material costs.  
- Estimates total materials required.  
- Calculates cost based on what is typically needed for that type of craft.

**Step 4 – Artisan estimates labor cost**  
- Applies his standard labor rate of **$15/hour**.  
- Makes an educated guess based on past experience for similar builds.

**Step 5 – Artisan determines overhead cost**  
- If materials < $120 → overhead = $25  
- If materials > $150 → overhead = $50  
- Overhead represents tool usage, storage, and general workshop costs.

**Step 6 – Artisan applies the markup multiplier**  
Multiplier depends on the size or purpose of the project:  
- Small pieces → **2.0×**  
- Medium pieces (chairs, benches, tables) → **2.2×**  
- Large pieces (headboards, toy chests, dining tables) → **3.0×**  
- Commercial clients (hotels/restaurants) → **always 3.0×**

**Step 7 – Artisan calculates the initial price**  
Total Price = (Materials + Labor + Overhead) × Multiplier

**Step 8 – Artisan sends initial quote to the customer**  
- Sent via WhatsApp/SMS/email.  
- Customer reviews the cost.  
- Customer may request clarification or adjustments.

**Step 9 – Customer partially pays or waits to gather funds**  
- Customers sometimes send small amounts (e.g., 10%) early.  
- **These do NOT authorize the project to begin.**  
- Artisan does not start until full 50% deposit is met.

**Step 10 – Customer pays the 50% deposit**  
- Required deposit to authorize materials purchase.  
- Customer sends via cash or bank transfer.  
- Artisan records deposit in notebook.

**Step 11 – Artisan purchases materials**  
- After the 50% deposit is received.  
- Keeps receipts for accurate tracking.

**Step 12 – Artisan updates timeline**  
- Within two days of purchasing materials, artisan provides an updated and more realistic timeline for completion.  
- Timeline is primarily based on **size category**:  
  - Small → 2–5 days  
  - Medium → 7–10 days  
  - Large → 14+ days  

**Step 13 – Artisan begins crafting the item**  
- Work starts only after materials are purchased and timeline is sent.

**Step 14 – Artisan may encounter complications**  
Examples:  
- Weather delays (rain interfering with drying/painting)  
- Material defects  
- Unexpected adjustments needed  
- Tool-related slowdowns  
- Customer delayed responses  

**Step 15 – Artisan logs issues in notebook**  
- Records complications or delays.  
- These may affect timeline but he continues unless customer action is required.

**Step 16 – Mid-project update (optional but ideal)**  
- Artisan attempts to give a progress update halfway through.  
- However, customer response delays can stall work.

**Step 17 – Customer requests design change (optional)**  
- If customer changes design mid-project:  
  - Artisan recalculates cost **the same day**.  
  - Adjusts timeline accordingly.  
  - Communicates new price and requirements.  
  - Customer must reconfirm.

**Step 18 – Artisan completes the custom craft**  
- Once done, the artisan prepares the piece for pickup storage.

**Step 19 – First notification with photo (2 days before pickup)**  
- Sends photo of finished project through SMS/WhatsApp/email.  
- Confirms that the agreed pickup date still works.

**Step 20 – Day-of pickup reminder (no photo)**  
- Sends a simple reminder message on the day of pickup.

**Step 21 – Customer arrives for pickup**  
- Customer inspects the piece.  

**Step 22 – Customer pays remaining 50% balance**  
- Artisan receives final payment (cash or bank transfer).  
- **No item is released without full payment.**

**Step 23 – Artisan prepares and prints invoice**  
- Uses Word template.  
- Gives customer the printed copy.

**Step 24 – Artisan hands over the custom craft**  
- Only after payment and invoice are finalized.

**Step 25 – Artisan updates Excel**  
- Logs sale and financial details.  
- Marks the custom product as completed.  
- No physical “inventory” update is required since this is not a stock item.

---

### 3.3 Alternate / Exception Paths

**A1 – Insufficient deposit**  
- Customer pays less than 50%.  
- Artisan does NOT begin the project.  
- Materials are NOT purchased.  

**A2 – Project not feasible**  
- Artisan declines the request at Step 2.

**A3 – Customer disappears or delays confirmation**  
- Artisan may pause the timeline and await a response.  
- This can delay multiple projects.

**A4 – Weather delay**  
- Rain delays drying, painting, or outdoor steps.  
- Artisan logs delay and notifies customer if delay > 2 days.

**A5 – Design change after work has started**  
- Artisan recalculates cost immediately.  
- Timeline is reset or extended.  
- Customer must reconfirm.

**A6 – Late pickup**  
- After 2-day grace period, daily storage fee begins (100 pesos/day or $5/day).  
- Artisan communicates fees via WhatsApp/SMS/email.

## 4. Workflow #3 – Late Pickup & Storage Fee Handling (As-Is)

### 4.1 Description

This workflow models what happens when a **customer does not pick up a finished item on the agreed date**, and how Mr. Carrion applies his **grace period** and **daily storage fee** policy. This applies to both **stock items** and **custom crafts** that have been fully completed and set aside for pickup.

Actors:
- **Customer**
- **Artisan (Mr. Carrion)**

Tools/Systems involved:
- WhatsApp / SMS / Email  
- Physical storage space (bedroom/living room)  
- Notebook  
- Excel (optional, if he chooses to record storage charges)  

---

### 4.2 Main Flow – On-Time Pickup (No Fees)

**Step 1 – Pickup date is agreed in advance**  
- During the order or completion process, the customer and Mr. Carrion agree on a specific pickup date and, roughly, time.

**Step 2 – First notification with photo (2 days before pickup)**  
- Already part of the main workflows for stock and custom orders.  
- Confirms that the item is ready and reminds the customer of the pickup date.

**Step 3 – Day-of pickup reminder**  
- On the agreed day, Mr. Carrion sends a reminder message (no photo) to confirm that the customer is still coming.

**Step 4 – Customer arrives on or before agreed date**  
- Customer picks up the item on time.  
- No storage fee is applied.  
- Payment and handover follow the normal workflow.  

*(In this case, Workflow #3 does not deviate from the main stock/custom flows.)*

---

### 4.3 Late Pickup Flow – Applying Grace Period and Storage Fees

**Step 1 – Agreed pickup date passes without pickup**  
- The scheduled pickup date arrives and the customer does not show up.  
- The item remains stored in Mr. Carrion’s home (bedroom/living room or protected area).

**Step 2 – Grace period begins (Day 1 and Day 2 after pickup date)**  
- Mr. Carrion applies a **2-day grace period** after the agreed pickup date.  
- During these 2 days, no fee is charged.  
- The item continues to occupy storage space.

**Step 3 – Storage fee starts on Day 3**  
- Starting on the **3rd day after the agreed pickup date**, a **daily storage fee** is applied.  
- Fee rule: **100 pesos/day (≈ $5/day)**.  
- This fee is tied to the customer’s delay, not to the type of craft.

**Step 4 – Artisan may notify customer about accumulating fees**  
- Using WhatsApp/SMS/email, Mr. Carrion may send a message explaining:  
  - that the agreed date has passed,  
  - that a 2-day grace period was given,  
  - that daily storage charges are now accumulating.  

**Step 5 – Customer eventually responds and schedules a new pickup**  
- Customer contacts Mr. Carrion to arrange a new pickup date.  
- At this point, the total days of delay can be counted.

**Step 6 – Customer arrives for late pickup**  
- Customer comes to pick up the item on the new date.

**Step 7 – Calculation of total amount due**  
- Total due includes:  
  - remaining balance for the craft (if any), plus  
  - accumulated storage fees (number of chargeable days × daily fee).  

**Step 8 – Customer pays full amount (craft + fees)**  
- Payment is made via cash or bank transfer.  
- As with all other workflows, **no item is released without full payment**, including storage fees.

**Step 9 – Item is handed over to customer**  
- Item is given to the customer only after payment is confirmed.

**Step 10 – Optional recording of storage fee in Excel**  
- If desired, Mr. Carrion may log the additional storage revenue in Excel.  
- The item is treated as sold/closed in his normal tracking.

---

### 4.4 Alternate / Exception Paths

**A1 – Customer never returns**  
- Item remains stored long-term.  
- At some point, Mr. Carrion may decide to:  
  - reclassify the item as available for sale again,  
  - resell it to another customer.  
- Storage fee may be considered forfeited or ignored if no final pickup occurs.

**A2 – Artisan chooses not to enforce fees**  
- For certain customers (e.g., family or special cases), he may waive or reduce the fee.  
- This is handled informally and not always recorded.

**A3 – Cancellation after grace period**  
- Customer cancels after the pickup date.  
- Item is returned to general inventory.  
- Any prior payments (if any) are handled according to his personal judgment (case by case).
