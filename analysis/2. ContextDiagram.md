## Purpose  
This context diagram defines the **system boundary** for *The Artisan Vault* and identifies all **external entities** that interact with the system. It shows the **flow of information** into and out of the system without describing internal processes. (Ref: Data & Process Modeling chapter, Context Diagram section)
