## 1. Purpose

This log is used to review and validate the captured requirements (functional, non-functional, and business rules) for The Artisan Vault. It ensures that each requirement:

- Aligns with stakeholder goals (especially Mr. Carrion)  
- Supports the core business workflows  
- Is clear, testable, and realistic

## 4. Business Rules Validation

Business rules are specific policies that must always be enforced by the system.

| Rule ID | Business Rule Description                                                                 | Source (Interview / Workflow)                             | Must the System Enforce It? (Y/N) | Notes                                                     |
|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| BR-01   | No custom job starts until a 50% deposit is received.                                      | Custom Order Interview, Workflow #2                       | Y                                 | Core protection rule for material and time cost.         |

## 5. Summary

- Functional requirements were validated against:  
  - key use cases,  
  - the three main workflows,  
  - and the interview with Mr. Carrion.  

- Non-functional requirements ensure that the system is not only functional, but secure, usable, maintainable, and aligned with realistic expectations for a small artisan business.

- Business rules capture the most critical policies that define how Mr. Carrion operates today. These rules must either be enforced or strongly supported by the system.
