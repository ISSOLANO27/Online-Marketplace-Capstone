# Online Marketplace System – SDLC Capstone Project

Welcome! This repository contains my full Systems Analysis & Design capstone project: an Online Marketplace System designed using the complete Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC). 

The goal of this project is to design a functional online shopping platform for a single retailer, including features for browsing products, managing customer accounts, handling orders, and maintaining inventory. Every artifact in this repo was created step-by-step using SDLC best practices.

## Repository Structure

The project is organized into folders that reflect each SDLC phase. This makes it easy to follow the system’s development from concept to final documentation.


Each folder contains the deliverables for its phase—requirements, diagrams, mockups, testing assets, and the final compiled report.

##  What This Project Demonstrates

- Mastery of SDLC phases from planning to maintenance  
- Functional and nonfunctional requirements engineering  
- Business case development and feasibility analysis  
- Data and process modeling (DFDs, ERD, data dictionary)  
- User interface design through mockups  
- Testing strategy creation and documentation  
- System architecture and implementation planning  
- Clean documentation organization using GitHub version control  

##  Tools & Techniques Used

- **Wix / Figma** – user interface mockups  
- **Draw.io / Lucidchart** – diagrams and modeling  
- **Git & GitHub** – version control and organization  
- **Standard SDLC frameworks** – structured analysis and documentation  



Thanks for stopping by and exploring the project!
